Tide Calculations
#################

When planning a voyage, it is important to know the times of high and 
low tides to ensure that it is safe to pass over shallow ground, or
underneath low bridges or power lines. The tides can also be used to
predict direction and strength of current around headlands and bays.

Tide predications tables are produced by various authorities around
the world. In New Zealand, they are published by LINZ.

The tide predictions published by LINZ are available in both a printable 
format (PDF) and a machine-readable format (CSV).

The time and height of the tide is predicted for each high and low tide at
a few ports around the country. These 15 or 20 ports are called primary ports.

The time and height of the tide can be very different at places not very far
from the few primary ports. LINZ publishes coefficients to calculate the 
time and height of tide at many other secondary ports, based on the
predictions for the associated primary port.


Calculations
============

Time of tide at a secondary port
--------------------------------

The time of a high (low) tide at a secondary port is calculated by adding
an offset to the time of the high (low) tide at the corresponding primary
port.


Height of tide at a secondary port
----------------------------------

The range of the tide

  h_secondary = MSL_secondary + (h_primary - MSL_primary) * ratio_secondary)


Trip planning
=============

A trip being planned will take place over a period of time, and will include
a number of ports of interest. The set of ports of interest are collected 
into a group so that the same group can be used to plan a number of different
trips in the same region.

Ports
-----
* Primary port
* Secondary port
* Port

Tides
-----
* Primary tide event
* Secondary tide event
* Tide event

Trip planning
-------------
* Trip
* Region
* Ports in region
* Tide events during trip  

Data management
---------------
* Port data file
* Prediction data file


Operations
==========

1. Add port details from a port data file, overriding all port details already
   loaded

2. Add tide predictions at a primary port, overriding tide predicition at the
   same port for the same year.

3. Add a new trip, and a new region and associated ports in the region.

4. Show tide events during one or more trips.



Decisions to make
=================

1. Calculate and store all secondary tide events when a new set of 
   tide predictions is added.
   
2. Calculate them all, but only when needed, using a SQL view.
   
3. Calculate and store only the secondary tide events actually needed for 
   trip planning.
   
4. Calculate only the secondary tide events actually needed, and only when
   needed.
