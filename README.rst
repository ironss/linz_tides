##########

Lua modules to calculate New Zealand tide prediction from the LINZ tide data.


How big will the database be
----------------------------

* Number of ports:  250  (15 primary, 220 secondary)
* Number of events: 1460 per year per port
* Number of events per year: 365000

However, we only create secondary tide events when we create a trip, for the
ports in the region where the trip occurs, and for the dates associated with
the trip.

So the database is relatively small.


Features
========

1. Read tide predictions for primary ports from a CSV file downloaded from LINZ -- DONE

2. Adjust to NZDT when appropriate -- DONE

3. Calculate tide time prediction for secondary ports -- DONE -- read data from LINZ data file..

4. Calculate tide height predicition for secondary ports -- DONE

5. Set up a number of different regions, with ports in that region -- DONE

6. Set up a number of trips, with a region that the trip will
   take place, a start date and an end date  -- DONE


TODO
----

1. Find timezone library, rather than using my own.

2. Choose port and time range to generate output for

3. Format output for easy import into spreadsheet::

4. Use a view for the secondary tide events rather than a table. Don't
   think this is possible, as we have to do a cartesian product of
      secondary_ports x primary_tide_events
